# petFinder
Solo project - Swift A project combining APIs and my love for cats. Using the PetFinder API, the user can search for a specific type of pet in a certain area.
After entering the necessary details, the app pulls up a list of pets around the location. A picture of the animal, their name, age, and gender is displayed to help users narrow down their search for the perfect furry friend.
